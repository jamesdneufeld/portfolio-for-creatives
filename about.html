        <h3>Testimonials</h3>

        <p>“It was so interesting to see other classmates’ websites full of their personalities!” — <a href="https://solyoon.me/" target="_blank">Sol Yoon</a></p>

        <p>“It was so cool to code a full website with my personal branding. Be brave! Try something new, bold, and fun! I learned so much by committing to my design choices. It builds my confidence to know I can pick up a complex skill like coding and make it match my design style.” — <a href="https://lilyrosen.ca/" target="_blank">Lily Rosen</a></p>

        <p>“Have fun learning a new skill.” — <a href="https://jacobchong.com/" target="_blank">Jacob Chong</a></p>

        <p>“A highlight of this course was planning out and implementing fun, quirky Easter eggs for my website.” — <a href="https://emmado.com/" target="_blank">Emma Do</a></p>

        <p>“Highlights of this course were the final website presentation. It was great watching everyone’s site coming together and getting feedback. For me, the highlight was all the customization I did on my website and coding many parts from scratch. This class was the most useful for me out of all the IDEA classes, as I now have an official site to show everyone.” — <a href="https://shrutikarthikeyan.com/" target="_blank">Shruti Karthikeyan</a></p>

        <p>“Coding, for me, is super fun, and I do plan on delving into it more in the next year to really polish up my website. Starting out with a template for our coded website was helpful to refresh my mind on coding. I like that we were able to get a lot of independent working time to curate our own website. I found it helpful going through past examples from other grads on how they set up their website, which I found to be influential for my own website. I also loved seeing everyone’s websites during presentation day, and it gave me ideas on how to improve mine.” — <a href="https://angelicablanch.com/" target="_blank">Angelica Blanch</a></p>

        <p>“Some of my highlights of this course were seeing everyone’s websites at the end of the course and being able to code again. I enjoyed getting to do something that’s different from our usual design courses and being able to shut off my brain and focus on the code. It’s also satisfying to see all of your work come together at the end.” — <a href="https://carmenhuang.com/" target="_blank">Carmen Huang</a></p>

        <p>“Most helpful class for me so far at IDEA—very thoughtful instructions.” — <a href="https://melcreative.ca/" target="_blank">Amelia Bouman</a></p>
